.. Dyna documentation master file

Welcome to Dyna!
=================================

Dyna is an new declarative programming language developed at
`Johns Hopkins University <http://cs.jhu.edu>`_.

This site documents the new version being developed at http://github.com/nwf/dyna.
The new version has been used to teach but is not yet complete or
efficient; you may file issues at http://github.com/nwf/dyna/issues.
An older design with a fairly efficient compiler can be found at http://dyna.org.  

.. warning:: Please be advised that this documentation, the implementation,
   and indeed the language itself are rapidly changing.

.. warning:: Some programs may not terminate.  Control-C will
   interrupt the program's execution.

.. todo:: should we also try to add something like the automatic
